This test implements a motor control system simulation with 3 nodes: a motor node, a controller node, and a setpoint node. The setpoint node is updated less frequently than the other two nodes.  It produces the speed setpoint for the controller, which is changed randomly everytime it is updated.

To run the demo:
- Requires YARP network: start yarpserver.
- Build the entire project.
- Run ./nodemotor, ./nodectrl, ./nodesetpoint, ./smntest2
- If gnuplot is available, after the simulation finishes, gnuplot will be called by nodectrl to plot the results; press ENTER to close the plot window and exit.
